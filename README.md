# Standalone_Shell-Shell_User-Manager_Sockets-Communication_Interrupt-Handling
 Create processes and how to communicate between processes. The project is programmed in C and executed under Unix. Let users send their commands via sockets to the UM. Thus, each user can input their commands from their own windows. Also, instead of writing the output for each user to a user file, we will pass the output to the user process to be displayed on the userâ€™s window. In this case, UM will be a dispatcher (a common server-client design, like web servers, file servers, etc.) for forwarding messages between users and their Shsh processes.
